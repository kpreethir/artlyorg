      <p class="description">
        Vincent Van Gogh was one of the few artists who had the ability to draw
        out every bit of significance from the different colors and hues of
        natural objects. Many of his works focused on flowers, but his painting
        titled Irises was exceptionally famous among those who enjoy nature
        paintings.Irises was painted in 1889 after Van Gogh had endured an
        especially dark time in his personal struggle with mental illness. He
        often engaged in self mutilation, famously cutting off his ear in one
        instance, before being admitted to an asylum in Saint-Rémy, France.
        There, he would paint more than 100 works, many focusing on the
        institution’s garden. His work titled Irises was done just a year before
        the artist’s death and was submitted to the Salon des Indépendants by
        his brother.
