      <p class="description">
        Piet Mondrian, born in 1872 Netherlands, was a pioneer of abstract art.
        His early works were figurative style, but he quickly transitioned to an
        extreme abstract concept, using only geometric shapes in his paintings.
        Most of his works as an adult were paintings of squares and lines with
        solid colors. Though he didnâ€™t illustrate religious figures, he used the
        natural and spiritual worlds as inspiration for his paintings. The son
        of a painter, Mondrian grew up learning how to draw from his father. As
        an adult, he became a teacher, pursuing painting on the side until he
        moved to Paris and altered his name.
